  Tomorrow, just get all the data flows working. Use Cognito and Gateway to work on requests.

  Restart it now make a proper login/signup page myself, using the API. Commit once this is taken care of.
  After that, continue down the list of milestones, one-by-one (note that step 2 should primarily be concerned with integrating Django to work with the database
  and thinking about how Django would work with Gateway while probably testing a direct Angular to Django connection).
  Then, probably will just go back and forth between Angular-Django-PostgreSQL data flows as I go down the list
